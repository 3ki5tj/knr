The source code files with exX-X.c are symbolic links to
the actual source code.
For examples, ex2-9.c (for exercise 2-9) is a symbolic link to
the actual source code bits.c.

Personal favorite lists:
ex2-1: limits.c         template-like programming
ex2-6 to 2-9: bits.c    fun
ex3-3: expand.c         succinct code (no brace)
