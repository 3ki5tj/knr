Selected answers to exercises in the book The C Programming Language (Second Edition)
by Brian W. Kernighan, Dennis M. Ritchie (often refered to as K&R).

Symbolic links with names matching the exercise numbers are made to
the actual source code, e.g., the code for exercise 2-9 is ex2-9.c,
which is a symbolic link to the actual source code bits.c.

Personal favorite lists:
ex2-1: limits.c   template-like programming
ex2-6 to 2-9: bits.c   fun
ex3-3: expand.c   succinct code (no brace)
